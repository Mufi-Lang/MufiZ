- Added Test Suites that brought plenty of fixes to builtins
- Switched `stdlib_error` to make use of `runtimeError` so that it can also
provide line numbers to the user.
## Added Builtin Functions

- `assert`: Checks if the given condition is true, if not, it panics.
- `simd_stat`: Checks if SIMD is supported on the current platform.
- `iter`: Creates an iterator from an array or a float vector.
- `next`: Advances the iterator and returns the next element.
- `has_next`: Checks if the iterator has more elements.
- `reset`: Resets the iterator to the beginning.
- `skip`: Skips the next `n` elements.
