# Release Notes for Echo (0.10.0)

- Started on May 29th 2025.
- Released on December 31st 2025

## New Features

- Foreach loop support `foreach(v in vector)`
- Added complex number parsing var c = 2 + 3i 
- Added multiline string (`hello`;) and comment (`/# #/`) support.
- Added `end` keyword for indexing arrays last element (like Matlab)
- Added `const` support for immutable variables
- Added `format()` and `f()` functions for formatting strings like `format("Hello, {}!", "World")` and `f("Hello, {}!", "World")`.
- Added hashtable syntax using `#{key: value}` such as `var table = #{"key": 4};` and indexing using `table["key"]`.
- Added `switch` statement support `switch(expression) { case value: {expression; break;}, ... }`
- Added experimental range support (`..=` and `..`)
- Added pair type `key => value`
- Added Matrix type support (`[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`) and added indexing support using `mat[row][col]` syntax. 
  - For iterating on `foreach`, you will need to run `foreach(a in flatten(mat))`

## Other Changes
- Upgraded Zig toolchain to `v0.15.2` 
- Changed Float Vector to be dynamic 
- Improved Hash Table to use Standard Library
- Reworked memory management to use Zig’s Allocator type and prioritize safety checks and memory leak detection. We choose to use Zig’s General Purpose Allocator and for lifetime objects we use arena allocation. 
- Reworked REPL editor that allows for multi-line statements
- Better error messaging in the language and token column reporting is implemented 
- Dynamic String hashing depending on length of string to provide optimal performance.
