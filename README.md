# MufiZ

> This project uses the Zig `v0.13.0`

üåê [mufi-lang.mokareads.org](https://mufi-lang.mokareads.org)

This project aims to integrate the Mufi-Lang compiler with the Zig language by using the
Zig Build system. We hope to integrate more features with this language and see how nicely
we can utilize both languages in unity. The advantage of Zig's Build system is easy cross-compatibility and caching, and as we integrate more,
we can ensure more memory safety.

## Usage:

```shell
$ mufiz --help
    -h, --help
            Displays this help and exit.

    -v, --version
            Prints the version and codename.

    -r, --run <str>
            Runs a Mufi Script

    -l, --link <str>
            Link another Mufi Script when interpreting

        --repl
            Runs Mufi Repl system
```
